      Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of
      the Spanish Golden Age.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a "yellow veil" of dust that had gathered
      since the previous restoration in the 19th century.
    </p>

      The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been
      damaged in any way, but because it looked different.
